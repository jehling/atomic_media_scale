# **Atomic Media Scale**

My attempt at creating an atomic scale which evaluates media using standardized definitions to promote consistent understanding and widespread usage.

# **Writing Mechanics**
## Internal Realism
**1. Stable Logic Jumps**
> But can they beat Goku?

A narrative maintains suspension of disbelief by constructing logical precedents or reference points for future events.

- Suppose three enemies exist such that their power scaling is A < B < C. If the protagonist cannot defeat A, they should not be capable of defeating B or C under normal circumstances. 
- If a mechanic performs X function, it should *always* perform X function. 
- If a mechanic evolves, the established world must offer a plausible explanation for what triggered said evolution. 

**2. Consistent Character Behavior**

Characters behave in line with their established traits and core values. Behavior only diverges when the character evolves. These behavioral traits also provide room for character reactions.

- Suppose Jessie wants to protect children. This being the case, he will never intentionally harm a child. If someone else harms a child, Jessie will have a strong reaction.

However, external forces can put characters in situations where they go against their core beliefs provided enough pressure. 

- Suppose Walter doesn't believe in murder. It is established that Walter values his life above all others. If placed in a situation where murder will guarantee his own safety, it is highly likely Walter will commit murder.

## Chekhov's Gun

> If a **gun** is hung on a wall, it should be fired in a later scene.

Plot beats, mechanics, and characters are always setup and paid off at a later point in time. This results in fluid transitions within the work without breaking suspension of disbelief.

## Actions Have Consequences

**1. The Ripple Effect**
> A tossed stone in a calm pond disturbs more than the peace.

When a stone is tossed into a pond, it produces a ripple which extends outward in all directions. Upon reflecting off the walls of the pond, the original ripple spawns additional waves that begin to interfere with each other. The resulting cacophony of constructive and destructive interference produces a complex mesh of *reactions* from the initial stone. 

The story should react in a similar manner. Large events within the world impact different parts of the world and its characters. This results in increasingly complex causal chains.

**2. Large Events = Lasting Impacts**
> People die when they are killed. 

Whenever a significant event occurs within a story, there should be a lasting reminder of what occurred. 

- If a character wipes a village off the map, they should not then undo all of the damage they caused.
- If a character dies, they stay dead.
- If a character is brought back to life, the experience permanently changes them in some meaningful way. (See **Equivalent Exchange**)

**3. Equivalent Exchange**
> For something of value to be gained, something of equal value must be lost. 

Any time something of value is gained within a story, there must be a price associated with it. Doing so not only reinforces the value of what is gained, but also prevents conflict resolution from feeling cheap or unearned.

- To gain power A, the protagonist must satisfy condition B.
- To bring C back to life, a price of D must be paid.

## Characters

**1. Breadth**
> Establishes baseline information about a character.

A character's breadth provides information that serves as building blocks for higher level aspects of their behavior (see **Depth**). 
- Background Information
- Visual Design
- Vocal Mannerisms
- Personal Habits
- Likes & Dislikes

**2. Depth**
> Yield complexity using establised building blocks

By tying high level character behavior to established information (see **Breadth**), writers introduce more complexity to their characters. This allows for a higher degree of comprehension and ability to empathize with their viewpoints. 

- Personality
- Ideology
- Decision Making 
- Trauma

**3. Relative Growth**
> Meaningful changes from accumulated experiences

A character's capacity for meaningful growth is largely tied to their intended purpose within the narrative.  

**1. Static Characters**
> What you see is what you get
- Extremely limited range of personality traits & behavior
- **Breadth** but no **Depth**. 
- Static character traits

**2. Pseudo-Dynamic Characters**
> More than meets the eye
- Moderate range of personality traits & behavior
- **Breadth & Depth** define present character
- Only major arcs result in paradigm shifts.

**3. Dynamic Characters**
> "Real People"
- Infinite range of personality traits & behaviors
- Character scales with acquired **Breadth & Depth** 
- Major and minor arcs result in proportional paradigm shifts
