# **Atomic Media Scale**

My attempt at creating an atomic scale which evaluates media using standardized definitions to promote consistent understanding and widespread usage.

# **Writing Mechanics**
## Internal Realism
**1. Stable Logic Jumps**

Narrative maintains suspension of disbelief by constructing logical precedents or reference points for future events.

- Suppose three enemies exist such that their power scaling is A < B < C. If the protagonist cannot defeat A, they should not be capable of defeating B or C under normal circumstances. 

- Once the protagonist defeats A, they are then clear to power scale to fight B. They still cannot fight C. 

- Only after scaling to defeat B, thus defeating A by extension, will the protagonist be capable of fighting C. 

**2. Consistent Character Behavior**

Characters behave in line with their core values. 

- If Jessie doesn't like harming children, he will never harm children absent external forces.

## Chekov's Gun

> If, in the first act, you have hung a **gun** on the wall, it should be fired in a later scene. Otherwise, don't put it there.

Plot beats, mechanics, and characters are always setup and paid off at a later point in time. This results in fluid transitions within the work without breaking suspension of disbelief.

## Actions Have Consequences

**1. The Ripple Effect**
> A tossed stone in a calm pond disturbs more than the peace.

When a stone is tossed into a pond, it produces a ripple which extends outward in all directions. Upon reflecting off the walls of the pond, the original ripple spawns additional waves that begin to interfere with each other. The resulting cacophony of constructive and destructive interference produces a complex mesh of *reactions* from the initial stone. 

The story should react in a similar manner. Large events within the world impact different parts of the world and, by extension, its characters.

**2. Large Events = Lasting Impacts**
> People die when they are killed. 

Whenever a significant event occurs within a story, there should be a lasting reminder of what occurred. 

- If a character wipes a village off the map, they should not then undo all of the damage they caused.

- If a character dies, they stay dead.

- If a character is brought back to life, the experience permanently changes them in some meaningful way. (See **Equivalent Exchange**)

**3. Equivalent Exchange**
> For something of value to be gained, something of equal value must be lost. 

Any time something of value is gained within a story, there must be a price associated with it. Doing so not only reinforces the value of what is gained, but also prevents conflict resolution from feeling cheap or unearned.
